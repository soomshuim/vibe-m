## Canonical Blocks (Copy & Paste)

### Block A: Harmony Guard (붙박이)
```
Lead vocal remains single and dominant. No stacked or choir-like harmonies.
Vocal line may intensify dynamically (higher register, belt, falsetto lift), but no additional vocal layers.
```

### Block B: Energy Contract (붙박이)
```
Verse2 last 2 lines MUST rise in emotional intensity (higher register or falsetto encouraged).
Chorus first line hits peak: belt/higher register + 1 held note (longer sustain than any verse note).
Lead vocal energy may increase dynamically.
```

### Block C: Chorus2 + Bridge + Outro (붙박이)
```
Chorus2 bigger by arrangement (bass/drums energy, wider stereo); vocal may intensify but no layers added.
Bridge builds every bar; no energy drop into chorus.
Outro instrumental fade.
```

### Block D: EDM Guard (선택)
```
No EDM vocal processing (no vocoder, no vocal chops, minimal autotune).
```

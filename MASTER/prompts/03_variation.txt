[ROLE: Variation Designer]

Input:
- Seed DNA
- Track number
- Required variation slots (min 2)

Task:
Design a variation that is:
- Algorithmically distinct
- Perceptually coherent

Rules:
- Do NOT alter Seed constants
- Operate only within allowed variation slots

Steps:
1. Select variation slots
2. Describe how each slot changes (measurable terms)
3. Predict main risk (energy, vocal clarity, monotony)
4. Define QC focus points (Intro / Chorus / Outro)

Risk Assessment (v1.1):

**Vocal Energy Risk (필수 체크):**
| Risk | Condition | Verdict |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Verse2 lacks lift | No higher register or falsetto in last 2 lines | FAIL |
| Chorus sounds flat | No belt/intensity increase from verse | BORDERLINE |
| Over-safety suppression | "무난함" - energy dampened by layer prohibition | FAIL |

**Arrangement Risk:**
| Risk | Condition | Verdict |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Chorus not bigger | No arrangement lift (bass/drums/stereo) | BORDERLINE |
| Monotony | Same energy level throughout | BORDERLINE |

**Vocal Clarity Risk:**
| Risk | Condition | Verdict |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Intro mumbling | Diction unclear in 0:00~0:20 | FAIL |
| Outro noise | Click/cut noise in fade | FAIL |

---

Energy Permission Verification:

Before finalizing, verify:
1. Does Verse2 last 2 lines have explicit emotional intensity rise?
2. Does Chorus first line have belt/higher register permission?
3. Is energy increase separated from layer prohibition?

If any NO → Adjust before submission.

---

Output Format:
- Slot-by-slot breakdown
- Technical, concise language

**Final Verdict Question (Must Answer Before Verdict):**
> Does the Chorus feel more emotionally intense than Verse2 without adding layers?
> If NO → FAIL.

**Energy Reference (QC 기준):**
> Chorus peak note should sustain at least **1.5x longer** than any Verse note.

Final Line:
Verdict: SAFE / BORDERLINE / FAIL

---

**PASS Criteria (필수 충족):**

> PASS requires a perceptible vocal intensity peak in Chorus,
> even with a single vocal line.

- Verse2 last 2 lines: audible register/intensity rise
- Chorus first line: perceptibly higher or more intense than Verse2
- Chorus: 1 held note (longer sustain than any verse note) present
- Energy increase via delivery, not layering

**If output sounds "safe but unmemorable", it is FAIL.**

---

**FAIL conditions (즉시 탈락):**
- Verse2 lacks lift or register contrast
- Chorus sounds flat due to over-safety
- Chorus energy feels lower or equal to Verse2
- Chorus lacks a perceptible vocal intensity peak
- Chorus relies on vocal layering instead of energy increase
- Intro mumbling / Outro noise

**INVALID conditions (출력 무효):**
- Vocal Persona not explicitly stated (gender + tone + delivery)
- Any mandatory slot missing
- **S1-S9 Validation Table 없음**

---

**🔴 MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT (v1.6):**

> 출력 마지막에 반드시 S1-S9 체크리스트를 표로 붙일 것.
> 하나라도 비어 있으면 'FAIL'로 다시 생성.

```
## S1-S9 Validation Table (Variation)

| # | 슬롯 | Seed 값 | 변경 여부 | 상태 |
|---|------|--------|----------|------|
| S1 | Vocal Persona | [Seed에서 상속] | 유지/변경 | ✅/❌ |
| S2 | Vocal Processing | [Seed에서 상속] | 유지/변경 | ✅/❌ |
| S3 | Lead Instrument | [값] | 유지/변경 | ✅/❌ |
| S4 | Rhythm Source | [값] | 유지/변경 | ✅/❌ |
| S5 | BPM | [숫자] | 유지/변경 | ✅/❌ |
| S6 | Key/Mode | [조성] | 유지/변경 | ✅/❌ |
| S7 | Musicality Matrix | [유지] | 유지 | ✅ |
| S8 | Harmony Guard | [유지] | 유지 | ✅ |
| S9 | Chorus2 Expansion | [유지] | 유지 | ✅ |

**Validation Result: [9/9 PASS] 또는 [X/9 FAIL - 재생성 필요]**
```

**S1-S9 테이블 없는 출력 = 자동 INVALID**
**S1 비어있음 = 즉시 FAIL, 재생성**

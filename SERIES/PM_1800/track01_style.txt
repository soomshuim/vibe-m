Articulation. Clean, punchy modern mix. Very short room only.

Korean Funk-Pop / R&B, Neo-soul 115 BPM, Eb Major.
Eb Major base with subtle blues inflection in melody/riffs (occasional b3, b7 feel).

Harmony: very simple 2-chord loop. No jazzy extensions. Groove first.
Drums: tight dry kit. 16th hi-hat drives energy. Clap on 2&4. Kick supportive. No big fills.
Bass: clean funky synth bass, short rhythmic notes, locks to hats/clap.
Keys: minimal rhythmic stabs only, leave space. No lush pads or wide cinematic layers.

Arrangement: sparse verse. Pre-chorus drops to near silence.

Chorus snaps back with full groove, not louder vocals.

Vocal: single male lead only. Chest voice, speech-like rhythmic delivery.
Short phrases, precise consonants. Energy from timing, not power.
Hook: catchy, repetitive, playful and confident (not aggressive).
Outro: hook chant + groove fade.
